                Still nothing? Gee… Tough crowd. Ok, how about that - Reason Foundation not only publishes completely free Reason.com blog but also:
                <ul>
                    <li>publishes the monthly, critically-acclaimed Reason Magazine</li>
                    <li>promotes freedom through ReasonTV</li>
                    <li>Foundation's nonpartisan public policy research promotes choice, competition, and a dynamic market economy as the foundation for human dignity and progress</li>
                    <li>Reason produces rigorous, peer reviewed research and directly engages the policy process, seeking strategies that emphasize cooperation, flexibility, local knowledge, transparency, accountability and results. Through practical and innovative approaches to complex problems, Reason seeks to change the way people think about issues, and promote policies that allow and encourage individuals and voluntary institutions to flourish.</li>
                </ul>
